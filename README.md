# BDHsolver
 This Python program solves and shows binary, decimal, and hexadecimal answers

 Instructions:
 ! - To use this program you must run Python 3.x but the program was made on Python 3.9 if that matters.
 Anyways, the program pops up a "What would you like to solve today?" screen. You can do 1 for decimal, 2 for hexadecimal, or 3 for decimal.
 Pick one of those answers and then put in the appropiate numbers. If you don't pick the correct numbers a "You didn't put in a valid number, what the heck." will appear because you didn't put in the correct number
 If you put in the correct information, binary, hexidecimal, and decimal information will appear.
 After 3 seconds it will ask you either y or n to do this process again.
 If y then it will go back to the entire process again.
 If n then the program will say "Arrigato mr.program user and goodbye..." and then it will terminate the program.
